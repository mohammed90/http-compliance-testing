- section-9.1-9: 
   All general-purpose servers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support the methods GET and HEAD.
   All other methods are <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>.

- section-14-2: 
   Range requests are an <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> feature
   of HTTP, designed so that recipients not implementing this feature (or not
   supporting it for the target resource) can respond as if it is a normal
   GET request without impacting interoperability. Partial responses are
   indicated by a distinct status code to not be mistaken for full responses
   by caches that might not implement the feature.
