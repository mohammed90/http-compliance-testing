- section-14.4-5: 
   For byte ranges, a sender <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> indicate the complete length of the
   representation from which the range has been extracted, unless the complete
   length is unknown or difficult to determine. An asterisk character ("*") in
   place of the complete-length indicates that the representation length was
   unknown when the header field was generated.
