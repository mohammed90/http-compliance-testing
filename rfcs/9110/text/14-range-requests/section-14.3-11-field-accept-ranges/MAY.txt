- section-14.3-11: 
   The Accept-Ranges field <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be sent in a trailer section, but is preferred
   to be sent as a header field because the information is particularly useful
   for restarting large information transfers that have failed in mid-content
   (before the trailer section is received).
