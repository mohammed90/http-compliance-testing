- section-14.2-8: 
   A client that is requesting multiple ranges <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> list those ranges in
   ascending order (the order in which they would typically be received in a
   complete representation) unless there is a specific need to request a later
   part earlier. For example, a user agent processing a large representation
   with an internal catalog of parts might need to request later parts first,
   particularly if the representation consists of pages stored in reverse
   order and the user agent wishes to transfer one page at a time.
