- section-6-6: 
   Messages are intended to be "self-descriptive":
   everything a recipient needs to know about the message can be determined by
   looking at the message itself, after decoding or reconstituting parts that
   have been compressed or elided in transit, without requiring an
   understanding of the sender's current application state (established via
   prior messages). However, a client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> retain knowledge of the request when
   parsing, interpreting, or caching a corresponding response. For example,
   responses to the <xref target="HEAD" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">HEAD</xref> method look just like the beginning of a
   response to <xref target="GET" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">GET</xref> but cannot be parsed in the same manner.
