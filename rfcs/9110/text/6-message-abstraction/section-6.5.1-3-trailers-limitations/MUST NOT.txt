- section-6.5.1-3: 
   Trailer fields can be difficult to process by intermediaries that forward
   messages from one protocol version to another. If the entire message can be
   buffered in transit, some intermediaries could merge trailer fields into
   the header section (as appropriate) before it is forwarded. However, in
   most cases, the trailers are simply discarded.
   A recipient <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> merge a trailer field into a header section unless
   the recipient understands the corresponding header field definition and
   that definition explicitly permits and defines how trailer field values
   can be safely merged.
