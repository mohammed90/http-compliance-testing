- section-6.2-8: 
   A recipient that receives a message with a major version number that it
   implements and a minor version number higher than what it implements
   <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> process the message as if it
   were in the highest minor version within that major version to which the
   recipient is conformant. A recipient can assume that a message with a
   higher minor version, when sent to a recipient that has not yet indicated
   support for that higher version, is sufficiently backwards-compatible to be
   safely processed by any implementation of the same major version.
