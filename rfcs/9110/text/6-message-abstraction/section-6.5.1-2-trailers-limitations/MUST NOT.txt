- section-6.5.1-2: 
   Many fields cannot be processed outside the header section because
   their evaluation is necessary prior to receiving the content, such as
   those that describe message framing, routing, authentication,
   request modifiers, response controls, or content format.
   A sender <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> generate a trailer field unless the sender knows the
   corresponding header field name's definition permits the field to be sent
   in trailers.
