- section-6.6.1-5: 
   A sender that generates a Date header field <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> generate its
   field value as the best available approximation of the date and time of
   message generation. In theory, the date ought to represent the moment just
   before generating the message content. In practice, a sender can generate
   the date value at any time during message origination.
