- section-6.2-6: 
   A client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> send a lower request version if it is known that
   the server incorrectly implements the HTTP specification, but only
   after the client has attempted at least one normal request and determined
   from the response status code or header fields (e.g., <xref target="field.server" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Server</xref>) that
   the server improperly handles higher request versions.
