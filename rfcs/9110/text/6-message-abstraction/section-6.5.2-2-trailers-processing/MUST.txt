- section-6.5.2-2: 
   Like header fields, trailer fields with the same name are processed in the
   order received; multiple trailer field lines with the same name have the
   equivalent semantics as appending the multiple values as a list of members.
   Trailer fields that might be generated more than once during a message
   <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be defined as a list-based field even if each member value is only
   processed once per field line received.
