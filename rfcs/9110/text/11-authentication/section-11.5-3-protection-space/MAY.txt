- section-11.5-3: 
   The protection space determines the domain over which credentials can
   be automatically applied. If a prior request has been authorized, the
   user agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> reuse the same credentials for all other requests within
   that protection space for a period of time determined by the authentication
   scheme, parameters, and/or user preferences (such as a configurable
   inactivity timeout).
