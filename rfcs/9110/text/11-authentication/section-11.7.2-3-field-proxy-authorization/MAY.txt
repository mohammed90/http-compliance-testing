- section-11.7.2-3: 
   Unlike <xref target="field.authorization" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Authorization</xref>, the Proxy-Authorization header field
   applies only to the next inbound proxy that demanded authentication using
   the <xref target="field.proxy-authenticate" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Proxy-Authenticate</xref> header field. When multiple proxies are used
   in a chain, the Proxy-Authorization header field is consumed by the first
   inbound proxy that was expecting to receive credentials. A proxy <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
   relay the credentials from the client request to the next proxy if that is
   the mechanism by which the proxies cooperatively authenticate a given
   request.
