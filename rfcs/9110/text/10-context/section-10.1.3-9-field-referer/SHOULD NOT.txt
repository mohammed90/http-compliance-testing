- section-10.1.3-9: 
   The Referer header field has the potential to reveal information about the request
   context or browsing history of the user, which is a privacy concern if the
   referring resource's identifier reveals personal information (such as an
   account name) or a resource that is supposed to be confidential (such as
   behind a firewall or internal to a secured service). Most general-purpose
   user agents do not send the Referer header field when the referring
   resource is a local "file" or "data" URI. A user agent <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> send a
   <xref target="field.referer" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Referer</xref> header field if the referring resource was accessed with
   a secure protocol and the request target has an origin differing from that
   of the referring resource, unless the referring resource explicitly allows
   Referer to be sent. A user agent <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> send a
   <xref target="field.referer" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Referer</xref> header field in an unsecured HTTP request if the
   referring resource was accessed with a secure protocol.
   See <xref target="sensitive.information.in.uris" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 17.9"/> for additional
   security considerations.
