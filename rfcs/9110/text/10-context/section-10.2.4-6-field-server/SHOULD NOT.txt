- section-10.2.4-6: 
   An origin server <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> generate a Server header field containing needlessly
   fine-grained detail and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> limit the addition of subproducts by third
   parties. Overly long and detailed Server field values increase response
   latency and potentially reveal internal implementation details that might
   make it (slightly) easier for attackers to find and exploit known security
   holes.
