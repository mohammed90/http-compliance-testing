- section-10.1.3-10: 
   Some intermediaries have been known to indiscriminately remove Referer
   header fields from outgoing requests. This has the unfortunate side effect
   of interfering with protection against CSRF attacks, which can be far
   more harmful to their users. Intermediaries and user agent extensions that
   wish to limit information disclosure in Referer ought to restrict their
   changes to specific edits, such as replacing internal domain names with
   pseudonyms or truncating the query and/or path components.
   An intermediary <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> modify or delete the Referer header field when
   the field value shares the same scheme and host as the target URI.
