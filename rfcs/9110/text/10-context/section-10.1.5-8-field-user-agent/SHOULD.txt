- section-10.1.5-8: 
   A user agent <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> generate a User-Agent header field containing needlessly
   fine-grained detail and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> limit the addition of subproducts by third
   parties. Overly long and detailed User-Agent field values increase request
   latency and the risk of a user being identified against their wishes
   ("fingerprinting").
