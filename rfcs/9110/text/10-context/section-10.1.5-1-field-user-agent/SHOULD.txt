   The "User-Agent" header field contains information about the user agent
   originating the request, which is often used by servers to help identify
   the scope of reported interoperability problems, to work around or tailor
   responses to avoid particular user agent limitations, and for analytics
   regarding browser or operating system use. A user agent <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send
   a User-Agent header field in each request unless specifically configured not
   to do so.
