- section-10.2.2-5: 
   If the Location value provided in a <xref target="status.3xx" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">3xx (Redirection)</xref>
   response does not have a fragment component, a user agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> process the
   redirection as if the value inherits the fragment component of the URI
   reference used to generate the target URI (i.e., the redirection
   inherits the original reference's fragment, if any).
