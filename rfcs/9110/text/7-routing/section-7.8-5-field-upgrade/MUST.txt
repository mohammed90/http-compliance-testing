- section-7.8-5: 
   A server that sends a <xref target="status.101" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">101 (Switching Protocols)</xref> response
   <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send an Upgrade header field to indicate the new protocol(s) to
   which the connection is being switched; if multiple protocol layers are
   being switched, the sender <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> list the protocols in layer-ascending
   order. A server <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> switch to a protocol that was not indicated by
   the client in the corresponding request's Upgrade header field.
   A server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> choose to ignore the order of preference indicated by the
   client and select the new protocol(s) based on other factors, such as the
   nature of the request or the current load on the server.
