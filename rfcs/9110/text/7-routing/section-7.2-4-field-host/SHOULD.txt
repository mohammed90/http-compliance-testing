- section-7.2-4: 
   The target URI's authority information is critical for handling a
   request. A user agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> generate a Host header field in a request
   unless it sends that information as an ":authority" pseudo-header field.
   A user agent that sends Host <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send it as the first field in the
   header section of a request.
