- section-7.6.3-6: 
   The received-by portion is normally the host and optional
   port number of a recipient server or client that subsequently forwarded the
   message.
   However, if the real host is considered to be sensitive information, a
   sender <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> replace it with a pseudonym. If a port is not provided,
   a recipient <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> interpret that as meaning it was received on the default
   port, if any, for the received-protocol.
