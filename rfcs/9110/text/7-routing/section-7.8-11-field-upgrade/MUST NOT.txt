- section-7.8-11: 
   For example, if the Upgrade header field is received in a GET request
   and the server decides to switch protocols, it first responds
   with a <xref target="status.101" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">101 (Switching Protocols)</xref> message in HTTP/1.1 and
   then immediately follows that with the new protocol's equivalent of a
   response to a GET on the target resource.  This allows a connection to be
   upgraded to protocols with the same semantics as HTTP without the
   latency cost of an additional round trip.  A server <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> switch
   protocols unless the received message semantics can be honored by the new
   protocol; an OPTIONS request can be honored by any protocol.
