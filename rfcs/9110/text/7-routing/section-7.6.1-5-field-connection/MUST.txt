- section-7.6.1-5: 
   Intermediaries <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> parse a received Connection
   header field before a message is forwarded and, for each
   connection-option in this field, remove any header or trailer field(s) from
   the message with the same name as the connection-option, and then
   remove the Connection header field itself (or replace it with the
   intermediary's own control options for the forwarded message).
