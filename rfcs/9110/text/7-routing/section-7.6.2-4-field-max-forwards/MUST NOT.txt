- section-7.6.2-4: 
   Each intermediary that receives a TRACE or OPTIONS request containing a
   Max-Forwards header field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> check and update its value prior to
   forwarding the request. If the received value is zero (0), the intermediary
   <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> forward the request; instead, the intermediary <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> respond as
   the final recipient. If the received Max-Forwards value is greater than
   zero, the intermediary <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> generate an updated Max-Forwards field in the
   forwarded message with a field value that is the lesser of a) the received
   value decremented by one (1) or b) the recipient's maximum supported value
   for Max-Forwards.
