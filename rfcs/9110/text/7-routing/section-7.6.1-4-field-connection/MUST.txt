- section-7.6.1-4: 
   When a field aside from Connection is used to supply control
   information for or about the current connection, the sender <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> list
   the corresponding field name within the Connection header field.
   Note that some versions of HTTP prohibit the use of fields for such
   information, and therefore do not allow the Connection field.
