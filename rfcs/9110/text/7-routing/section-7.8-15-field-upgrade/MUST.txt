- section-7.8-15: 
   A client cannot begin using an upgraded protocol on the connection until
   it has completely sent the request message (i.e., the client can't change
   the protocol it is sending in the middle of a message).
   If a server receives both an Upgrade and an <xref target="field.expect" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Expect</xref> header field
   with the "100-continue" expectation (<xref target="field.expect" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 10.1.1"/>), the
   server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send a <xref target="status.100" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">100 (Continue)</xref> response before sending
   a <xref target="status.101" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">101 (Switching Protocols)</xref> response.
