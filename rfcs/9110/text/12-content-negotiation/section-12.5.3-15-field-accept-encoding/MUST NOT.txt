- section-12.5.3-15: 
   Servers that fail a request due to an unsupported content coding ought to
   respond with a <xref target="status.415" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">415 (Unsupported Media Type)</xref> status and
   include an Accept-Encoding header field in that response, allowing
   clients to distinguish between issues related to content codings and media
   types. In order to avoid confusion with issues related to media types,
   servers that fail a request with a 415 status for reasons unrelated to
   content codings <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include the Accept-Encoding header
   field.
