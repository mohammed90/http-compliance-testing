- section-12.1-2: 
   Proactive negotiation is advantageous when the algorithm for
   selecting from among the available representations is difficult to
   describe to a user agent, or when the server desires to send its
   "best guess" to the user agent along with the first response (when that
   "best guess" is good enough for the user, this avoids the round-trip
   delay of a subsequent request). In order to improve the server's
   guess, a user agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> send request header fields that describe
   its preferences.
