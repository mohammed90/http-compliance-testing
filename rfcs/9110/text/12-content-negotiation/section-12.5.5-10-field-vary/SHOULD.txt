- section-12.5.5-10: 
   An origin server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> generate a Vary header field on a cacheable
   response when it wishes that response to be selectively reused for
   subsequent requests. Generally, that is the case when the response
   content has been tailored to better fit the preferences expressed by
   those selecting header fields, such as when an origin server has
   selected the response's language based on the request's
   <xref target="field.accept-language" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Accept-Language</xref> header field.
