- section-12.5.5-4: 
   A list containing the member "*" signals that other aspects of the
   request might have played a role in selecting the response representation,
   possibly including aspects outside the message syntax (e.g., the
   client's network address).
   A recipient will not be able to determine whether this response is
   appropriate for a later request without forwarding the request to the
   origin server. A proxy <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> generate "*" in a Vary field value.
