- section-12.5.3-12: 
   An Accept-Encoding header field with a field value that is empty
   implies that the user agent does not want any content coding in response.
   If a non-empty Accept-Encoding header field is present in a request and none of the
   available representations for the response have a content coding that
   is listed as acceptable, the origin server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send a response
   without any content coding unless the identity coding is indicated as unacceptable.
