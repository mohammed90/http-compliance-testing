- section-3.8-1: 
   A "cache" is a local store of previous response messages and the
   subsystem that controls its message storage, retrieval, and deletion.
   A cache stores cacheable responses in order to reduce the response
   time and network bandwidth consumption on future, equivalent
   requests. Any client or server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> employ a cache, though a cache
   cannot be used while acting as a tunnel.
