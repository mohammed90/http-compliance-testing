- section-3.3-5: 
   As a result, a server <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
   assume that two requests on the same connection are from the same user
   agent unless the connection is secured and specific to that agent.
   Some non-standard HTTP extensions (e.g., <xref target="RFC4559" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4559"/>) have
   been known to violate this requirement, resulting in security and
   interoperability problems.
