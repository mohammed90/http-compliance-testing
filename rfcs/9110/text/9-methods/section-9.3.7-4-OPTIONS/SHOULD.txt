- section-9.3.7-4: 
   A server generating a successful response to OPTIONS <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send any
   header that might indicate optional features implemented by the
   server and applicable to the target resource (e.g., <xref target="field.allow" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Allow</xref>),
   including potential extensions not defined by this specification.
   The response content, if any, might also describe the communication options
   in a machine or human-readable representation. A standard format for such a
   representation is not defined by this specification, but might be defined by
   future extensions to HTTP.
