- section-9.2.1-6: 
   When a resource is constructed such that parameters within the target URI
   have the effect of selecting an action, it is the resource
   owner's responsibility to ensure that the action is consistent with the
   request method semantics.
   For example, it is common for Web-based content editing software
   to use actions within query parameters, such as "page?do=delete".
   If the purpose of such a resource is to perform an unsafe action, then
   the resource owner <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> disable or disallow that action when it is
   accessed using a safe request method. Failure to do so will result in
   unfortunate side effects when automated processes perform a GET on
   every URI reference for the sake of link maintenance, pre-fetching,
   building a search index, etc.
