- section-9.3.2-3: 
   Although request message framing is independent of the method used,
   content received in a HEAD request has no generally defined semantics,
   cannot alter the meaning or target of the request, and might lead some
   implementations to reject the request and close the connection because of
   its potential as a request smuggling attack
   (<xref target="HTTP11" section="11.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-11.2" derivedContent="HTTP/1.1"/>).
   A client <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> generate content in a HEAD request unless it is
   made directly to an origin server that has previously indicated,
   in or out of band, that such a request has a purpose and will be adequately
   supported. An origin server <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> rely on private agreements to
   receive content, since participants in HTTP communication are often
   unaware of intermediaries along the request chain.
