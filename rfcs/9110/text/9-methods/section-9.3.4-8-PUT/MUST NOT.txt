- section-9.3.4-8: 
   An origin server <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> send a validator field
   (<xref target="response.validator" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 8.8"/>), such as an <xref target="field.etag" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">ETag</xref> or
   <xref target="field.last-modified" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Last-Modified</xref> field, in a successful response to PUT unless
   the request's representation data was saved without any transformation
   applied to the content (i.e., the resource's new representation data is
   identical to the content received in the PUT request) and the
   validator field value reflects the new representation.
   This requirement allows a user agent to know when the representation it
   sent (and retains in memory) is the result of the PUT, and thus it doesn't
   need to be retrieved again from the origin server. The new validator(s)
   received in the response can be used for future conditional requests in
   order to prevent accidental overwrites (<xref target="preconditions" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 13.1"/>).
