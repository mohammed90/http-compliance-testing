- section-9.3.4-10: 
   Proper interpretation of a PUT request presumes that the user agent knows
   which target resource is desired. A service that selects a proper URI on
   behalf of the client, after receiving a state-changing request, <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be
   implemented using the POST method rather than PUT. If the origin server
   will not make the requested PUT state change to the target resource and
   instead wishes to have it applied to a different resource, such as when the
   resource has been moved to a different URI, then the origin server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
   send an appropriate <xref target="status.3xx" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">3xx (Redirection)</xref> response; the
   user agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> then make its own decision regarding whether or not to
   redirect the request.
