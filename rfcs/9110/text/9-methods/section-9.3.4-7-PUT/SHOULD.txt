- section-9.3.4-7: 
   This extends to how header and trailer fields are stored; while common
   header fields like <xref target="field.content-type" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Content-Type</xref> will typically be stored
   and returned upon subsequent GET requests, header and trailer field
   handling is specific to the resource that received the request. As a result,
   an origin server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> ignore unrecognized header and trailer fields
   received in a PUT request (i.e., not save them as part of the resource
   state).
