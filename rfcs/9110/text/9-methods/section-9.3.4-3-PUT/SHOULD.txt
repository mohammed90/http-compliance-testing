- section-9.3.4-3: 
   An origin server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> verify that the PUT representation is consistent
   with its configured constraints for the target resource. For example, if
   an origin server determines a resource's representation metadata based on
   the URI, then the origin server needs to ensure that the content received
   in a successful PUT request is consistent with that metadata. When a PUT
   representation is inconsistent with the target resource, the origin
   server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> either make them consistent, by transforming the
   representation or changing the resource configuration, or respond
   with an appropriate error message containing sufficient information
   to explain why the representation is unsuitable.  The
   <xref target="status.409" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">409 (Conflict)</xref> or <xref target="status.415" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">415 (Unsupported Media Type)</xref>
   status codes are suggested, with the latter being specific to constraints on
   <xref target="field.content-type" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Content-Type</xref> values.
