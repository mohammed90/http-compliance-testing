- section-9.3.6-6: 
   CONNECT is intended for use in requests to a proxy.
   The recipient can establish a tunnel either by directly connecting to
   the server identified by the request target or, if configured to use
   another proxy, by forwarding the CONNECT request to the next inbound proxy.
   An origin server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> accept a CONNECT request, but most origin servers
   do not implement CONNECT.
