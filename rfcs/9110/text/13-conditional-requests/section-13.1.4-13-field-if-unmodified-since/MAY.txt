- section-13.1.4-13: 
   An origin server that evaluates an If-Unmodified-Since condition <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
   perform the requested method if the condition evaluates to false.
   Instead, the origin server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> indicate that the conditional request
   failed by responding with a <xref target="status.412" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">412 (Precondition Failed)</xref>
   status code. Alternatively, if the request is a state-changing operation
   that appears to have already been applied to the selected representation,
   the origin server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> respond with a <xref target="status.2xx" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">2xx (Successful)</xref>
   status code
   (i.e., the change requested by the user agent has already succeeded, but
   the user agent might not be aware of it, perhaps because the prior response
   was lost or an equivalent change was made by some other user agent).
