- section-13.2.1-1: 
   Except when excluded below, a recipient cache or origin server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
   evaluate received request preconditions after it has successfully performed
   its normal request checks and just before it would process the request content
   (if any) or perform the action associated with the request method.
   A server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore all received preconditions if its response to the
   same request without those conditions, prior to processing the request content,
   would have been a status code other than a <xref target="status.2xx" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">2xx (Successful)</xref>
   or <xref target="status.412" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">412 (Precondition Failed)</xref>.
   In other words, redirects and failures that can be detected before
   significant processing occurs take precedence over the evaluation
   of preconditions.
