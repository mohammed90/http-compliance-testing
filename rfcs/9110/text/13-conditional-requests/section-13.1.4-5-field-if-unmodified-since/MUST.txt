- section-13.1.4-5: 
   A recipient <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore If-Unmodified-Since if the request contains an
   <xref target="field.if-match" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">If-Match</xref> header field; the condition in
   <xref target="field.if-match" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">If-Match</xref> is considered to be a more accurate replacement for
   the condition in If-Unmodified-Since, and the two are only combined for the
   sake of interoperating with older intermediaries that might not implement
   <xref target="field.if-match" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">If-Match</xref>.
