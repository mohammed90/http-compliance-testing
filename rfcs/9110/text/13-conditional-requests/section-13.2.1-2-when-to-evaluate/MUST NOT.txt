- section-13.2.1-2: 
   A server that is not the origin server for the target resource and cannot
   act as a cache for requests on the target resource <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> evaluate the
   conditional request header fields defined by this specification, and it
   <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> forward them if the request is forwarded, since the generating
   client intends that they be evaluated by a server that can provide a
   current representation.
   Likewise, a server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore the conditional request header fields
   defined by this specification when received with a request method that does
   not involve the selection or modification of a
   <xref target="selected.representation" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">selected representation</xref>, such as CONNECT, OPTIONS, or TRACE.
