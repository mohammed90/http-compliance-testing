- section-13.1.3-5: 
   A recipient <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore If-Modified-Since if the request contains an
   <xref target="field.if-none-match" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">If-None-Match</xref> header field; the condition in
   <xref target="field.if-none-match" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">If-None-Match</xref> is considered to be a more accurate
   replacement for the condition in If-Modified-Since, and the two are only
   combined for the sake of interoperating with older intermediaries that
   might not implement <xref target="field.if-none-match" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">If-None-Match</xref>.
