- section-5.5-5: 
   Field values containing CR, LF, or NUL characters are invalid and dangerous,
   due to the varying ways that implementations might parse and interpret
   those characters; a recipient of CR, LF, or NUL within a field value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
   either reject the message or replace each of those characters with SP
   before further processing or forwarding of that message. Field values
   containing other CTL characters are also invalid; however,
   recipients <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> retain such characters for the sake of robustness when
   they appear within a safe context (e.g., an application-specific quoted
   string that will not be processed by any downstream HTTP parser).
