- section-5.6.4-3: 
  
   The backslash octet ("\") can be used as a single-octet
   quoting mechanism within quoted-string and comment constructs.
   Recipients that process the value of a quoted-string <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> handle a
   quoted-pair as if it were replaced by the octet following the backslash.
