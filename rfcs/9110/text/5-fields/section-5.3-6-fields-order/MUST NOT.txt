- section-5.3-6: 
   A server <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> apply a request to the target resource until it
   receives the entire request header section, since later header field lines
   might include conditionals, authentication credentials, or deliberately
   misleading duplicate header fields that could impact request processing.
