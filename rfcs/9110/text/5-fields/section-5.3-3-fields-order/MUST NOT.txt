- section-5.3-3: 
   This means that, aside from the well-known exception noted below, a sender
   <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> generate multiple field lines with the same name in a message
   (whether in the headers or trailers) or append a field line when a field
   line of the same name already exists in the message, unless that field's
   definition allows multiple field line values to be recombined as a
   comma-separated list (i.e., at least one alternative of the field's
   definition allows a comma-separated list, such as an ABNF rule of
   #(values) defined in <xref target="abnf.extension" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.6.1"/>).
