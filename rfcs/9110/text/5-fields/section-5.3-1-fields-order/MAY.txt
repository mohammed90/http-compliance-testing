- section-5.3-1: 
   A recipient <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> combine multiple field lines within a field section that
   have the same field name
   into one field line, without changing the semantics of the message, by
   appending each subsequent field line value to the initial field line value
   in order, separated by a comma (",") and optional whitespace
   (<xref target="whitespace" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">OWS</xref>, defined in <xref target="whitespace" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.6.3"/>).
   For consistency, use comma SP.
