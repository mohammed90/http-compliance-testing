- section-4.3.3-7: 
   When an "https" URI is used within a context that calls for access to
   the indicated resource, a client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> attempt access by resolving the
   host identifier to an IP address, establishing a TCP connection to that
   address on the indicated port, securing the connection end-to-end by
   successfully initiating TLS over TCP with confidentiality and integrity
   protection, and sending over that connection an HTTP request message
   containing a request target that matches the client's target URI
   (<xref target="target.resource" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7.1"/>).
