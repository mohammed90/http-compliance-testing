- section-4.2.2-6: 
   A client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure that its HTTP requests for an "https" resource are
   secured, prior to being communicated, and that it only accepts secured
   responses to those requests. Note that the definition of what cryptographic
   mechanisms are acceptable to client and server are usually negotiated and
   can change over time.
