- section-4.3.4-1: 
   To establish a <xref target="https.uri" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">secured</xref> connection to dereference a URI,
   a client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify that the service's identity is an acceptable
   match for the URI's origin server. Certificate verification is used to
   prevent server impersonation by an on-path attacker or by an attacker
   that controls name resolution. This process requires that a client be
   configured with a set of trust anchors.
