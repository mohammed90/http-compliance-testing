   before proceeding (see <xref target="user.agent" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.5"/>) or
   terminate the connection with a bad certificate error. Automated

   and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> terminate the connection (with a bad certificate error).
   Automated clients <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> provide a configuration setting that disables
