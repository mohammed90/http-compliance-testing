- section-2.3-3: 
   At a minimum, a recipient <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to parse and process protocol
   element lengths that are at least as long as the values that it generates
   for those same protocol elements in other messages. For example, an origin
   server that publishes very long URI references to its own resources needs
   to be able to parse and process those same references when received as a
   target URI.
