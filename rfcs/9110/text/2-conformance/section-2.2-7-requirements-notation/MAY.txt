- section-2.2-7: 
   When an implementation fails semantic conformance, recipients of that
   implementation's messages will eventually develop workarounds to adjust
   their behavior accordingly. A recipient <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> employ such workarounds while
   remaining conformant to this protocol if the workarounds are limited to the
   implementations at fault. For example, servers often scan portions of the
   User-Agent field value, and user agents often scan the Server field value,
   to adjust their own behavior with respect to known bugs or poorly chosen
   defaults.
