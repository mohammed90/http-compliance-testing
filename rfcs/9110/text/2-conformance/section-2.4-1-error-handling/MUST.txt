- section-2.4-1: 
   A recipient <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> interpret a received protocol element according to the
   semantics defined for it by this specification, including extensions to
   this specification, unless the recipient has determined (through experience
   or configuration) that the sender incorrectly implements what is implied by
   those semantics.
   For example, an origin server might disregard the contents of a received
   <xref target="field.accept-encoding" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Accept-Encoding</xref> header field if inspection of the
   <xref target="field.user-agent" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">User-Agent</xref> header field indicates a specific implementation
   version that is known to fail on receipt of certain content codings.
