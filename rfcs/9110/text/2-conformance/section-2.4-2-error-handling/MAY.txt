- section-2.4-2: 
   Unless noted otherwise, a recipient <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> attempt to recover a usable
   protocol element from an invalid construct.  HTTP does not define
   specific error handling mechanisms except when they have a direct impact
   on security, since different applications of the protocol require
   different error handling strategies.  For example, a Web browser might
   wish to transparently recover from a response where the
   <xref target="field.location" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Location</xref> header field doesn't parse according to the ABNF,
   whereas a systems control client might consider any form of error recovery
   to be dangerous.
