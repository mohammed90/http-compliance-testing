- section-8.4-5: 
   If one or more encodings have been applied to a representation, the sender
   that applied the encodings <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> generate a Content-Encoding header field
   that lists the content codings in the order in which they were applied.
   Note that the coding named "identity" is reserved for its special role
   in <xref target="field.accept-encoding" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Accept-Encoding</xref> and thus <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be included.
