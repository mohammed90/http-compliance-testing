- section-8.8.3-8: 
   A sender <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> send the ETag field in a trailer section (see
   <xref target="trailer.fields" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.5"/>). However, since trailers are often
   ignored, it is preferable to send ETag as a header field unless the
   entity tag is generated while sending the content.
