- section-8.7-9: 
   An origin server that receives a Content-Location field in a request
   message <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> treat the information as transitory request context rather
   than as metadata to be saved verbatim as part of the representation.
   An origin server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use that context to guide in processing the
   request or to save it for other uses, such as within source links or
   versioning metadata. However, an origin server <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> use such context
   information to alter the request semantics.
