- section-8.6-9: 
   Aside from the cases defined above, in the absence of Transfer-Encoding,
   an origin server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send a Content-Length header field when the
   content size is known prior to sending the complete header section.
   This will allow downstream recipients to measure transfer progress,
   know when a received message is complete, and potentially reuse the
   connection for additional requests.
