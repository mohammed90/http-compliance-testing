- section-8.7-5: 
   If Content-Location is included in a <xref target="status.2xx" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">2xx (Successful)</xref>
   response message and its value refers (after conversion to absolute form)
   to a URI that is the same as the target URI, then
   the recipient <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> consider the content to be a current representation of
   that resource at the time indicated by the message origination date.
   For a GET (<xref target="GET" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 9.3.1"/>) or HEAD (<xref target="HEAD" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 9.3.2"/>) request,
   this is the same as the default semantics when no Content-Location is
   provided by the server.
   For a state-changing request like PUT (<xref target="PUT" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 9.3.4"/>) or
   POST (<xref target="POST" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 9.3.3"/>), it implies that the server's response
   contains the new representation of that resource, thereby distinguishing it
   from representations that might only report about the action
   (e.g., "It worked!").
   This allows authoring applications to update their local copies without
   the need for a subsequent GET request.
