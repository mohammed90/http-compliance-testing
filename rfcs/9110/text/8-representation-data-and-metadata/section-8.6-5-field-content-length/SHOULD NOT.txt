- section-8.6-5: 
   A user agent <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send Content-Length in a request when the method
   defines a meaning for enclosed content and it is not sending
   Transfer-Encoding.
   For example, a user agent normally sends Content-Length in a POST request
   even when the value is 0 (indicating empty content).
   A user agent <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> send a
   Content-Length header field when the request message does not contain
   content and the method semantics do not anticipate such data.
