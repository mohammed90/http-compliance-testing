- section-8.8.3.1-3: 
   An origin server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send an ETag for any selected representation
   for which detection of changes can be reasonably and consistently
   determined, since the entity tag's use in conditional requests and
   evaluating cache freshness (<xref target="CACHING" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CACHING"/>) can
   substantially reduce unnecessary transfers and significantly
   improve service availability, scalability, and reliability.
