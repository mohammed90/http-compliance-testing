- section-8.8.1-7: 
   An origin server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> change a weak entity tag whenever it
   considers prior representations to be unacceptable as a substitute for
   the current representation. In other words, a weak entity tag ought to
   change whenever the origin server wants caches to invalidate old
   responses.
