- section-8.6-13: 
   Likewise, a sender <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> forward a message with a Content-Length
   header field value that does not match the ABNF above, with one exception:
   a recipient of a Content-Length header field value consisting of the same
   decimal value repeated as a comma-separated list (e.g,
   "Content-Length: 42, 42") <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> either reject the message as invalid or
   replace that invalid field value with a single instance of the decimal
   value, since this likely indicates that a duplicate was generated or
   combined by an upstream message processor.
