- section-8.8.2.1-3: 
   An origin server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> obtain the Last-Modified value of the
   representation as close as possible to the time that it generates the
   <xref target="field.date" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Date</xref> field value for its response. This allows a recipient to
   make an accurate assessment of the representation's modification time,
   especially if the representation changes near the time that the
   response is generated.
