- section-8.8.2.1-1: 
   An origin server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send Last-Modified for any selected
   representation for which a last modification date can be reasonably
   and consistently determined, since its use in conditional requests
   and evaluating cache freshness (<xref target="CACHING" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CACHING"/>) can
   substantially reduce unnecessary transfers and significantly
   improve service availability and scalability.
