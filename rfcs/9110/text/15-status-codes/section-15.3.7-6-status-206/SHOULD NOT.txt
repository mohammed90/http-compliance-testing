- section-15.3.7-6: 
   A sender that generates a 206 response to a request with an <xref target="field.if-range" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">If-Range</xref>
   header field <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> generate other representation header
   fields beyond those required because the client
   already has a prior response containing those header fields.
   Otherwise, a sender <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> generate all of the representation header
   fields that would have been sent in a <xref target="status.200" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">200 (OK)</xref> response
   to the same request.
