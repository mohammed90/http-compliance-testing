- section-15.3.7.3-4: 
   If the most recent response is a <xref target="status.206" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">206 (Partial Content)</xref>
   response and at least one of the matching stored responses is a
   <xref target="status.200" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">200 (OK)</xref>, then the combined response header fields consist
   of the most recent 200 response's header fields. If all of the matching
   stored responses are 206 responses, then the stored response with the most
   recent header fields is used as the source of header fields for the
   combined response, except that the client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use other header fields
   provided in the new response, aside from <xref target="field.content-range" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Content-Range</xref>, to
   replace all instances of the corresponding header fields in the stored
   response.
