- section-15.4.5-4: 
   Since the goal of a 304 response is to minimize information transfer
   when the recipient already has one or more cached representations,
   a sender <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> generate representation metadata other
   than the above listed fields unless said metadata exists for the
   purpose of guiding cache updates (e.g., <xref target="field.last-modified" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Last-Modified</xref> might
   be useful if the response does not have an <xref target="field.etag" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">ETag</xref> field).
