   The 413 (Content Too Large) status code indicates
   that the server is refusing to process a request because the request
   content is larger than the server is willing or able to process.
   The server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> terminate the request, if the protocol version in use
   allows it; otherwise, the server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> close the connection.
