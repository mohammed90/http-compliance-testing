- section-15.3.7.3-5: 
   The combined response content consists of the union of partial content
   ranges within the new response and all of the matching stored responses.
   If the union consists of the entire range of the representation, then the
   client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> process the combined response as if it were a complete
   <xref target="status.200" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">200 (OK)</xref> response, including a <xref target="field.content-length" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Content-Length</xref>
   header field that reflects the complete length.
   Otherwise, the client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> process the set of continuous ranges as one of
   the following:
   an incomplete <xref target="status.200" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">200 (OK)</xref> response if the combined response is
   a prefix of the representation,
   a single <xref target="status.206" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">206 (Partial Content)</xref> response containing
   "multipart/byteranges" content, or
   multiple <xref target="status.206" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">206 (Partial Content)</xref> responses, each with one
   continuous range that is indicated by a <xref target="field.content-range" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Content-Range</xref> header
   field.
