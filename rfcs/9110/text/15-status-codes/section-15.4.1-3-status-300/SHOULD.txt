- section-15.4.1-3: 
   For request methods other than HEAD, the server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> generate content
   in the 300 response containing a list of representation metadata and URI
   reference(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most
   preferred. The user agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> make a selection from that list
   automatically if it understands the provided media type. A specific format
   for automatic selection is not defined by this specification because HTTP
   tries to remain orthogonal to the definition of its content.
   In practice, the representation is provided in some easily parsed format
   believed to be acceptable to the user agent, as determined by shared design
   or content negotiation, or in some commonly accepted hypertext format.
