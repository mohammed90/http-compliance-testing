- section-15.3.7.2-5: 
   A server <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> generate a multipart response to a request for a single
   range, since a client that does not request multiple parts might not
   support multipart responses. However, a server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> generate a
   "multipart/byteranges" response with only a single body part if multiple
   ranges were requested and only one range was found to be satisfiable or
   only one range remained after coalescing.
   A client that cannot process a "multipart/byteranges" response <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
   generate a request that asks for multiple ranges.
