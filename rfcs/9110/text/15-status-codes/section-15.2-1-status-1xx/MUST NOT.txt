- section-15.2-1: 
   The 1xx (Informational) class of status code indicates an
   interim response for communicating connection status or request progress
   prior to completing the requested action and sending a final response.
   Since HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status codes, a server <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> send
   a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client.
