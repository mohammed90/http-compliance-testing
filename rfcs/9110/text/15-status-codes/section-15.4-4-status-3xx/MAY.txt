- section-15.4-4: 
   If a <xref target="field.location" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Location</xref> header field
   (<xref target="field.location" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 10.2.2"/>) is provided, the user agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
   automatically redirect its request to the URI referenced by the Location
   field value, even if the specific status code is not understood.
   Automatic redirection needs to be done with care for methods not known to be
   <xref target="safe.methods" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">safe</xref>, as defined in <xref target="safe.methods" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 9.2.1"/>, since
   the user might not wish to redirect an unsafe request.
