- section-15.4.8-1: 
   The 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code indicates that the
   <xref target="target.resource" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">target resource</xref> resides temporarily under a different URI
   and the user agent <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> change the request method if it performs an
   automatic redirection to that URI.
   Since the redirection can change over time, the client ought to continue
   using the original target URI for future requests.
