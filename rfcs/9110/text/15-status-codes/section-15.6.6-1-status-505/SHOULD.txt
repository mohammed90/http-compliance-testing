- section-15.6.6-1: 
   The 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported) status code indicates
   that the server does not support, or refuses to support, the major version
   of HTTP that was used in the request message. The server is indicating that
   it is unable or unwilling to complete the request using the same major
   version as the client, as described in <xref target="protocol.version" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 2.5"/>, other than with this
   error message. The server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> generate a representation for the 505
   response that describes why that version is not supported and what other
   protocols are supported by that server.
