- section-15.3.7.2-4: 
   When multiple ranges are requested, a server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> coalesce any of the
   ranges that overlap, or that are separated by a gap that is smaller than the
   overhead of sending multiple parts, regardless of the order in which the
   corresponding range-spec appeared in the received <xref target="field.range" format="none" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="">Range</xref>
   header field. Since the typical overhead between each part of a
   "multipart/byteranges" is around 80 bytes, depending on the selected
   representation's media type and the chosen boundary parameter length, it
   can be less efficient to transfer many small disjoint parts than it is to
   transfer the entire selected representation.
