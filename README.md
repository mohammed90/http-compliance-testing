HTTP Compliance Test Suite
===========================

This repository aims to contain the input/output data comprising the HTTP compliance test suite. It also contains a simplistic parser to extract the rules from the XML.

# Tip
To find rules in the XML, search using the regular expression:

```regexp
<bcp14>\w+(\s\w+)?</bcp14>
```
